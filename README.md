# Library Management
Library management web app made using Vue.js and Vuetify

*This was made as an attempt for the **CS-1605 Database Management Systems** project at **MNNIT Allahabad***

***The project is still under development***


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Download or clone the repository onto your local machine.

Download the latest version of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) using instructions from [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html).

The simplest way to install Vue.js would be by using `npm`

```bash
# latest stable
$ npm install vue
```
The rest of the `node` dependencies need to be installed as well.

## Deployment

Change the directory to the recently downloaded directory.

```
cd library-management-vuejs
```

To deploy the site on the local machine `serve` must be run. Inside the project directory run

```
npm run serve
```

Once the project is compiled, open a browser and go to the `localhost:port` link shown in the terminal.
